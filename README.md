# 🎓 Teach Clone

**Teach Clone** is an AI-powered education platform where teachers upload video lectures, and AI creates a "clone" of their teaching persona. Students can then interact with these AI clones 24/7 to ask questions and learn.

Built for the **AI Hackathon**, this project demonstrates the power of **Google Gemini API** in education.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Role-Based Access**: Dedicated portals for Teachers, Students, and Admins.
*   **Video Analysis**: Uploaded videos are analyzed by Gemini 1.5 Flash to extract teaching style, tone, and common phrases.
*   **AI Personality Generation**: Creates a custom system prompt based on the teacher's unique style.
*   **Interactive Chat**: Students chat with the AI clone in a WhatsApp-style interface.
*   **Admin Dashboard**: Manage user approvals and review AI personalities before they go live.
*   **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Routing**: React Router DOM
*   **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai` SDK)
*   **Icons**: Lucide React
*   **Storage**: LocalStorage (Simulated Backend/Database for Demo)
